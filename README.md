# Face-Attendance-System


To run the code there are three different parts.
Every program is coded in python
The system for now consists of three sections of programs. --> db.py which is the program for the database. --> utilities.py which is the program for integration of face recognition models, mediapipe, numpy into the code. --> main.py which is the program which brings everything together.
