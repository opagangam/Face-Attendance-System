# Face-Attendance-System


To run the code, there are three different parts.
Every program is coded in Python.
The system, for now, consists of three sections of programs. --> database.py, which is the program for the database. --> utilities.py is the program for integrating face recognition models, mediapipe, and numpy into the code. --> main.py, which is the program that brings everything together.
